Finding the name or UUID of provisioning profiles for iOS or OSX development can be a pain.

This is a python script to list all of the provisioning profiles in your user's provisioning profile folder  by their UUID and name.

Edit the user variable (line #5) to be your user's name in OSX and run the script.

USE:
python ListProvisioningProfilesByName.py
